          <h2>What is a Landing Page?</h2>
          <p>A landing page is a web page focused on something specific, like an offer, an ebook, a course, a discount, etc. It has a form, a button, a title, an image or video, and a clear and compelling value proposal. The goal of a landing page is to convert visitors into leads or customers by capturing their information or driving them to take action. A well-designed landing page can generate more results for a business.</p>
